I am a machine learning researcher and member of the founding team of [Samaya AI](https://samaya.ai/).
We are developing an AI platform that provides research tools and LLM Agents for finance, serving leading institutions like Morgan Stanley and a number of Wall Street hedge funds.
My research focuses on retrieval (QA, RAG), planning with reinforcement learning, and evaluation of LLM outputs. 

Before joining Samaya, I did my PhD at the [ILCC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) in the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of [Barry Haddow](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bhaddow/)
and [Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/). 
My research focused on multilingual translation, large-scale pretraining, and improving performance in low-resource settings by extracting signal from unlabeled and synthetic data.
During my Ph.D., I did internships as Research Scientist at [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.facebook.com/)
in Menlo Park and as Applied Scientist at [Amazon AI](https://www.amazon.science/) in Palo Alto.


Before starting my PhD, I was a research assistant working on unsupervised text generation (summarization and translation) at
the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/)
with [Ion Androutsopoulos](http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/)
and [Alexandros Potamianos](https://slp.cs.ece.ntua.gr/potam/).
