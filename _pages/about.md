I am a machine learning researcher and member of the founding team of [Samaya AI](https://samaya.ai/). 
We are creating an knowledge discovery platform that uses large language models to extract insights from large volumes of data
and assist domain experts in decision-making.

Before joining Samaya, I did my PhD at the [ILCC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) in the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of [Barry Haddow](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bhaddow/)
and [Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/). During my Ph.D., I did internships as Research Scientist at [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.facebook.com/)
in Menlo Park and as Applied Scientist at [Amazon AI](https://www.amazon.science/) in Palo Alto.

Before starting my Ph.D., I was a research assistant working on unsupervised summarization at
the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/)
under the supervision of [Ion Androutsopoulos](http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/)
and [Alexandros Potamianos](https://slp.cs.ece.ntua.gr/potam/).

#### Research Interests
My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). In particular,
I am interested in text generation (e.g., summarization or machine translation), information retrieval,
and enabling models to learn with limited supervision.
