I am a second-year PhD student at the [ILCC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) in the University of Edinburgh and member of [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) group, under the supervision of [Barry Haddow](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bhaddow/) and [Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/). 
Preciously, I was working on my thesis at the National Technical University of Athens under the supervision of [Ion Androutsopoulos](http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/) and [Alexandros Potamianos](https://slp.cs.ece.ntua.gr/potam/).
I am interested in natural language generation (e.g., machine translation or summarization), in particular when there is scarcity of annotated data, as well as learning latent structure from text data.

 
Currently, I am working on low-resource machine translation with focus on improving performance in underrepresented languages, by exploiting prior knowledge from monolingual data. 
In the past, I have worked on unsupervised sentence compression using discrete latent variable models.
