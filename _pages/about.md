I am a (3rd) final year Ph.D. candidate at the [ILCC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) in the University of Edinburgh
and a member of [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/)
and [Statistical Machine Translation](http://www.statmt.org/ued/) groups,
under the supervision of [Barry Haddow](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bhaddow/)
and [Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/).

During my Ph.D., I have done internships as Research Scientist at [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.facebook.com/)
in Menlo Park and as Applied Scientist at [Amazon AI](https://www.amazon.science/) in Palo Alto.

**I am in the job market for industry research positions.**

In my research, I aim to enable machine learning models to learn with limited supervision,
by exploiting prior knowledge from unlabeled data.
I am particularly interested in _text generation_, such as summarization or machine translation,
and _multilingual_ natural language processing tasks.

The topic of my Ph.D. is low-resource machine translation. Besides a few high-resource languages, most languages have
limited or no parallel data and modern deep learning models are notoriously data-hungry.
In my work, I explore unsupervised and semi-supervised methods to reduce the need for annotated (parallel) data.
I am currently working on (non-parametric) _retrieval_ methods for multilingual machine translation.

Before starting my Ph.D., I was a research assistant at
the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/)
under the supervision of [Ion Androutsopoulos](http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/)
and [Alexandros Potamianos](https://slp.cs.ece.ntua.gr/potam/).
