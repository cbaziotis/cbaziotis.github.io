I am a final year Ph.D. candidate at the [ILCC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) in the University of Edinburgh
and a member of [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/)
under the supervision of [Barry Haddow](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bhaddow/)
and [Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/).

During my Ph.D., I have done internships as Research Scientist at [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.facebook.com/)
in Menlo Park and as Applied Scientist at [Amazon AI](https://www.amazon.science/) in Palo Alto.

**I am in the job market for industry Research Scientist positions.**

My research focuses on the intersection of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
I am interested text generation, such as summarization or machine translation, multilinguality, 
and enabling models to learn with limited supervision.

The topic of my PhD is low-resource machine translation. I have developed methods and studied how to best exploit prior
knowledge from unlabeled corpora to improve performance in languages with limited or no parallel data. 
Specifically, I have worked on semi-supervised and (multilingual) machine translation, 
improving parameter efficiency and scaling (hyper-network) architectures to larger sizes. 
My ongoing and final PhD project explores (non-parametric) retrieval.

Before starting my Ph.D., I was a research assistant working on unsupervised summarization at
the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/)
under the supervision of [Ion Androutsopoulos](http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/)
and [Alexandros Potamianos](https://slp.cs.ece.ntua.gr/potam/).
