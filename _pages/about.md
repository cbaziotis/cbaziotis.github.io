I am a (3rd) final year Ph.D. student at the [ILCC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) in the University of Edinburgh
and a member of [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/)
and [Statistical Machine Translation](http://www.statmt.org/ued/) groups,
under the supervision of [Barry Haddow](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bhaddow/)
and [Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/).

I previously interned as a Research Scientist at [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.facebook.com/) in Menlo Park 
and as an Applied Scientist at [Amazon AI](https://www.amazon.science/) in Palo Alto.

I am interested in enabling machine learning models to learn with little supervision, 
by exploiting prior knowledge from unlabeled data.
I am particularly interested in text generation tasks, such as summarization or machine translation,
and multilingual natural language processing.
